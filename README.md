# Diabetes Detection System

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can **predict whether a person has diabetes or not** based on key medical measurements.

## Purpose
- To explore supervised learning (binary classification) on a medical dataset.
- To compare multiple models and select the best performer.
- To practice feature scaling, model evaluation, and result visualization.

## Real-World Importance
Diabetes is a growing global health concern. Early detection through machine learning can:
- Enable timely medical intervention.
- Reduce long-term complications.
- Assist healthcare providers in mass screening.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization
- `scikit-learn` – Model training, evaluation, preprocessing

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (Bonus)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC Curve and AUC Score
- Accuracy Comparison Table
- Feature Importance (for Tree-based Models)

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify the best-performing model for predicting diabetes.
- Understand which medical features influence the prediction most.
- Produce clean visualizations for model comparison and interpretation.
